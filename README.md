Parking congestion is a daily headache in urban environments, and our system tackles this challenge by combining digital logic with real-time feedback to automate the parking process across multiple floors. Each car is assigned a unique 2-digit ticket (e.g., "21" for Floor 2, Slot 1), and the system handles entry, exit, invalid ticket detection, and full-lot notification, all displayed clearly on an LCD module.

⚙️ Core Highlights:
--> Modular & scalable Verilog design (parameterized for floors and slots)
--> LCD display interface with real-time status updates
--> Debounced input system for mechanical switch reliability
--> Simulation testbench & hardware deployment using Xilinx ISE
--> Synthesized & verified RTL design ready for FPGA deployment
